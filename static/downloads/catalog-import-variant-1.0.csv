***INSTRUCTIONS**,,,,,,,
You can delete the rows starting from above instruction line or fill upto the above instruction line,,,,,,,
Variants of a product belong to a group. Each product with the unique sku is distinguishined by combination of option and value,,,,,,,
You can have as many option/value columns as you want,,,,,,,
"To prevent typos, all groups, options and values will be trimmed (beginning and ending space removed) and lower case compared",,,,,,,
"That means ‘colOr’, ‘ Color’, ‘color’ are all the same",,,,,,,
"Double spaces inside the word will also be reduced to one space, so ‘Dark green’ and ‘Dark      green’ are the same",,,,,,,
"If a group, option or value does not exist yet, it will be created, however, a non-existent sku will not be auto created.",,,,,,,
"If you are importing a product to group1, color blue size small, but another product already exists in that same group with same option values, then no import will happen",,,,,,,
"That means no other products will also be imported, ie its an import all successfully or none at all.",,,,,,,
